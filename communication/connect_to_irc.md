  * Inernet Relay Chat (IRC) despite being an ancient chat protocol, is highly
 used in the JavaScript, Node.js, and general web development community. It's
 __important__ that you're familiar with it and can utilize it for help and to 
 connect with others in the community.
  * Connect to the class IRC channel #[codefellows](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23codefellows&uio=d4)
  on freenode.net and say hello.
  * If you want to be able to talk on the ##[javascript](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23%23javascript&uio=d4) channel, you need to register a nickname with Freenode. Type `/msg NickServ help` to get started from your IRC client.
  * Mac, best free client is [LimeChat](http://limechat.net/mac/). 
  * Unix, your package manager should have [XChat](http://xchat.org/) or [Pidgin](http://www.pidgin.im/). 
  * [http://www.irchelp.org/](http://www.irchelp.org/) is a great intro site if
 you're new to IRC.
  * A short article on irc etiquette: [http://geoff.greer.fm/2012/05/19/programmer-irc-etiquette/](http://geoff.greer.fm/2012/05/19/programmer-irc-etiquette/) Also see

There is no submission for this assignment. We'll see you on the #codefellows
channel in class, and/or on Gitter.IM. They are very useful for sending links to
everyone during class or asking questions in the evening.

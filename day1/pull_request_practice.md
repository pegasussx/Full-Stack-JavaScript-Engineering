# Pull Request Practice

### Create a folder with your name in the class repository.

Send a Pull Request to the class repo, with your own folder.

Inside your folder should be a single `readme.md` file that contains some basic
info about you. You should include your GitHub username, linked to your GitHub
profile. Also link to your Twitter account, your LinkedIn page, and any other
relevant information or online presence you'd like to share with your classmates.

I have created an example folder for myself.

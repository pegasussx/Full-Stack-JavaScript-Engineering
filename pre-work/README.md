# Pre-work

These pre-work tasks are recommended if you have any knowledge
gaps. They are here to make sure you have a good foundational knowledge of
JavaScript, jQuery, Git, and HTML/CSS

## Code School

We love CodeSchool.com's interactive courses. They are a great way to level up
before the Development Acellorator.

* [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com)
* [JavaScript Road Trip, Parts 1](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-1)
  [and 2](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-2)

  These cover the basics of JavaScript, you may already know this stuff,
  especially if you did a JavaScript Code Fellows foundations course. It's o.k.
  Skip to [JS Road Trip part 3](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-3)
  if you already have a good foundation.
* [Try Git](http://try.github.io)
* [Discover Chrome DevTools](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/ )

## Crockford on JS Lecture Series

Watch the first three [Crockford on JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxAXlJEmNMg) and any
other lectures in the series. The whole series is 8+ hours long, so this will be
something that will take some time.

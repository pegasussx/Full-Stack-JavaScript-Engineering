# Pre-work

These pre-work tasks are optional, but recommended if you have any knowledge
gaps. They are here to make sure you have a good foundational knowledge of
JavaScript, jQuery, Git, and HTML/CSS

## Code School

We love CodeSchool.com's interactive courses. They are a great way to level up
before the Development Acellorator.

* [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com)
* [JavaScript Road Trip, Parts 1](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-1)
  [and 2](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-2)
  
  These cover the basics of JavaScript, you may already know this stuff,
  especially if you did a JavaScript Code Fellows foundations course. It's o.k.
  Skip to [JS Road Trip part 3](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-3)
  if you already have a good foundation.
* [Try Git](http://try.github.io)
* [Discover Chrome DevTools](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/ )

## Crockford on JS Lecture Series

Watch the first [Crockford on JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxAXlJEmNMg) and any
other lectures in the series. The whole series is 8+ hours long, so this will be
something that will take some time.

## Asana

We use the Asana project management / TODO list system to keep track of assignments
in class. Watch the [Intro Video]( https://asana.com/guide/explore/videos/get-started)
and any other videos or help documents necessary there.

The only thing that's different about the way we use Asana is that an instructor
will check off when you are done with an assignment. You can always comment
"DONE" if you need us to review the work.

## Required State Paperwork
Code Fellows LLC is licensed as a technical training school by the State of
Washington and we follow all state laws and regulations. All students are
required to fill out two important forms: 

1: the demographic survey, and

Please print out these forms, fill them out and sign them, and bring them to the
first class meeting.

# Unit Testing

<blockquote>
In computer programming, [unit testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing)
is a software testing method by which individual units of source code, sets of
one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage
procedures, and operating procedures are tested to determine if they are fit for
use. Intuitively, one can view a unit as the smallest testable part of an
application. In procedural programming, a unit could be an entire module, but it
is more commonly an individual function or procedure. In object-oriented
programming, a unit is often an entire interface, such as a class, but could be
an individual method. Unit tests are short code fragments created by programmers
or occasionally by white box testers during the development process.

## With Mocha and Chai

<blockquote>
[Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) is a feature-rich JavaScript test
framework running on node.js and the browser, making asynchronous testing simple
and fun. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting,
while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
[Chai](http://chaijs.com) is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the
browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework
&hellip; Chai has several interfaces that allow the developer to choose the most
comfortable. The chain-capable BDD styles provide an expressive language &
readable style, while the TDD assert style provides a more classical feel
</blockquote>

Mocha and Chai (along with [Sinon]() which we will use later) are two of the
leading JS testing frameworks. They are frequently used together. An alternative
library that includes both features of Mocha, Chai, and Sinon is
[Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io).

## Testing NodeJS Objects on the Server Side

You can use the [Hello World Express] as a starting point for this tutorial, or
any other app you have. `cd` into your project's root folder.

Install Mocha as a global NPM module:
`npm install -g mocha`
We will do this globally to be able to use the `mocha` command from our command
line. We will also install Mocha and Chai as `devDependency`-ies in our project.
`npm install mocha chai --save-dev`


Make a test directory: `mkdir -p test/unit`

We will also make a `lib` directory to hold our "Plain Old JavaScript Objects"
(POJSOs)

Here's our simple Post object again:

```javascript
// lib/post.js
var Post = function(title) {
  return {title: title};
}

module.exports = Post;
```

Great, we have a Post object constructor that can initialize an instance of a
post with a title property.

Let's test to see that the constructor does what we think it will. The returned
object should have a title property.

```javascript
// test/post_test.js
var expect = require('chai').expect,
  Post = require('../lib/post');

describe('Post object tests', function() {
  var post;

  beforeEach(function() {
    post = new Post('A test post');
  });

  describe('constructor', function() {

    it('post should be truthy (exists)', function() {
      expect(post).to.be.ok;
    });

    it('post should have title property', function() {
      expect(post).to.have.property('title');
    });

    it('post title property matches beforeEach', function() {
      expect(post.title).to.equal('A test post');
    });

  });
});
```

Now we can run the mocha tests with the Mocha command line tool.

`mocha test/unit`

should do the trick!

The next step is to use the [grunt-simple-mocha](https://github.com/yaymukund/grunt-simple-mocha)
grunt plugin to be able to type `grunt test` and run this, and other, unit tests.

By now you should be familiar with Grunt, and configuring grunt plugins. Try it out.

## Testing JS Objects on the Client (Browser) Side

We can also run these tests in the browser environment. For this, we will need a
'test harness' HTML file.

### Install Mocha and Chai via Bower, too

`bower install mocha chai`

```html
<!-- test/browser/index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Post tests</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" media="all" href="../../bower_components/mocha/mocha.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div id="mocha"><p><a href=".">Index</a></p></div>
  <div id="messages"></div>
  <div id="fixtures"></div>
  <script src="../../bower_components/mocha/mocha.js"></script>
  <script src="../../bower_components/chai/chai.js"></script>
  <script src="../../lib/post.js"></script>
  <script>mocha.setup('bdd')</script>
  <script src="./post_test.js"></script>
  <script>mocha.run();</script>
</body>
</html>
```
and

```javascript
// test/browser/post_test.js
var expect = chai.expect;

describe('Post object tests', function() {
  var post;

  beforeEach(function() {
    post = new Post('A test post');
  });

  describe('constructor', function() {

    it('post should be truthy (exists)', function() {
      expect(post).to.be.ok;
    });

    it('post should have title property', function() {
      expect(post).to.have.property('title');
    });

    it('post title property matches beforeEach', function() {
      expect(post.title).to.equal('A test post');
    });

  });
});
```

Now open this HTML document in the browser.

`open test/browser/index.html`

_Stretch goal_: The next step is to use the [grunt-mocha](https://github.com/kmiyashiro/grunt-mocha)
grunt plugin to run these browser tests headlessly via PhantomJS.

__TODO__: This is a work in progress &hellip;

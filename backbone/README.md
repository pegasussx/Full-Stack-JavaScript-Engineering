# Backbone! All the vertebrae you never wanted

Backbone is a JavaScript library used for making Single Page Applications ([SPAs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application))


jQuery is awesome. Underscore is awesome. But Backbone is even better because it combines both, and gives your web app structure.

SPAs have these benefits (over server generated pages):

- Better User Experience. Code running in the browser is more responsive than waiting for a server generated page.

- Models "get your truth out of the DOM". There should only ever be a single source of truth for any given item of information in your code.


Why do we still teach Backbone over newer, more trendy frameworks?

- Because it's a library, not a framework (smaller)

- Because it's used at scale: Walmart.com. Enough said.

- Because you learn more JavaScript by using it than Angular or Ember

Backbone is used at other large companies, too:
- LinkedIn
- Trello
- AirBnB
- SoundCloud
- Foursquare
- Hulu
- USAToday

Backbone uses the MVC design pattern:

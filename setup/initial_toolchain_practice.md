# Test Out Grunt

By testing to see if `grunt` works on a project we can see if you have done most
of the setup tasks needed.

Let's just make sure your computer is set up with node and npm and can run tests.

1. Clone [this Github project](https://github.com/codefellows/simple_grunt).
2. Install the npm modules need with `npm install`
3. Run the tests with `grunt`, and [redirect the output](http://linuxcommand.org/lts0060.php)
 to a text file.

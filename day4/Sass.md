## Sass is CSS with Superpowers

Credit is due to [Dale Sande](https://twitter.com/anotheruiguy) for preparing this material.

Sass is an extension of CSS that adds power and elegance to the basic language. It allows you to use [variables](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#variables_), [nested rules](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#nested_rules), [mixins](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#mixins), [inline imports](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#import), and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized, and get small stylesheets up and running quickly, particularly with the help of the Compass style library.

Is [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) somewhat of a mystery to you? How does it work? Why do some say that it is better then CSS?

## Node Sass and Grunt

Sass was orignally a [Ruby gem](http://sass-lang.com/install), but it is also available as an [npm package](https://github.com/andrew/node-sass) now. You can `npm install node-sass` in your projects.
